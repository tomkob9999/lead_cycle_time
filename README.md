# Abstracting Pipelines for Cycle Time and Lead Time Analysis

## Abstract
This paper introduces a systematic method for analyzing the **cycle time** and **lead time** of complex pipelined systems by abstracting pipelines into subsystems. The proposed framework simplifies the calculation of system-wide metrics by focusing on bottlenecks and leveraging the additive nature of lead time. Additionally, it addresses merging pipelines, providing rules for determining cycle time and lead time in such scenarios. This approach enables scalable analysis of intricate systems across domains like manufacturing, networking, and software development.

## Introduction
Pipelining is a fundamental concept in system design, enabling parallelism and efficient resource utilization. However, as systems grow in complexity, analyzing performance metrics such as **cycle time** and **lead time** becomes challenging. This paper proposes a framework for abstracting pipelines into subsystems to simplify performance evaluation. The core claims are:
1. The **cycle time** of a system is determined by the slowest cycle time among its subsystems.
2. The **lead time** of a system is the sum of the lead times of its subsystems.
3. In merging pipelines, the cycle time depends on the slowest input process, while the lead time depends on the shortest input process.

## Definitions

### 1. Cycle Time
- **Cycle Time of a Stage**: The time required to complete one unit of work at a single stage.
- **Cycle Time of a Subsystem**: The bottleneck (i.e., the slowest cycle time) of the stages within the subsystem.
- **Cycle Time of a System**: The bottleneck among all subsystems.

Mathematically:

$$
\text{Cycle Time of Subsystem} = \max(\text{Cycle Times of Stages})
$$

$$
\text{Cycle Time of System} = \max(\text{Cycle Times of Subsystems})
$$

### 2. Lead Time
- **Lead Time of a Stage**: The time it takes for one unit to traverse the stage.
- **Lead Time of a Subsystem**: The sum of the lead times of its stages.
- **Lead Time of a System**: The sum of the lead times of its subsystems.

Mathematically:

$$
\text{Lead Time of System} = \sum_{i} \text{Lead Time of Subsystem}_i
$$

### 3. Merging Pipelines
When pipelines merge, the rules for calculating metrics are:
- **Cycle Time of the Merged Process**: Determined by the slowest cycle time among the inputs:

$$
\text{Cycle Time of Merged Process} = \max(\text{Cycle Times of Incoming Pipelines})
$$

- **Lead Time of the Merged Process**: Determined by the shortest lead time among the inputs:

$$
\text{Lead Time of Merged Process} = \min(\text{Lead Times of Incoming Pipelines})
$$

## Framework for Analysis

### 1. Subsystem Abstraction
A pipeline can be abstracted into subsystems, each with its own cycle time and lead time. This allows complex systems to be analyzed hierarchically:
- Calculate the cycle time and lead time of each subsystem independently.
- Aggregate these metrics to find the system-level cycle time and lead time.

### 2. Recursive Bottleneck Identification
The system-wide cycle time is determined by recursively identifying the slowest component at each level of abstraction:

$$
\text{Cycle Time of System} = \max(\text{Cycle Times of Subsystems})
$$

### 3. Additive Nature of Lead Time
The system-wide lead time is simply the sum of lead times across subsystems:

$$
\text{Lead Time of System} = \sum_{i} \text{Lead Time of Subsystem}_i
$$

### 4. Merging Pipelines
For merging pipelines:
- The **cycle time** is dominated by the slowest input.
- The **lead time** is dominated by the fastest input.

## Example

### Problem Setup
Consider a system with three subsystems:
1. **Subsystem A**: 
   - Cycle Time = 6 ms
   - Lead Time = 18 ms
2. **Subsystem B**: 
   - Cycle Time = 4 ms
   - Lead Time = 10 ms
3. **Subsystem C**: 
   - Merges Subsystems A and B

### Calculations
1. **Cycle Time of Subsystem C**:
   - Subsystem C merges A and B.
   - Cycle Time = $\max(6, 4) = 6$ ms.

2. **Lead Time of Subsystem C**:
   - Lead Time = $\min(18, 10) = 10$ ms.

3. **Cycle Time of System**:
   - $\max(6, 4, 6) = 6$ ms.

4. **Lead Time of System**:
   - $\text{Lead Time of System} = 18 + 10 + 10 = 38$ ms.

## Applications

### 1. Manufacturing Systems
- Use the framework to identify bottlenecks in assembly lines.
- Optimize throughput by parallelizing bottleneck stages.

### 2. Networking
- Analyze packet flow through routers and switches to optimize throughput.
- Use lead time metrics to ensure low latency in real-time communication.

### 3. Software Systems
- Optimize microservices pipelines by balancing parallel workloads.
- Minimize latency in data processing pipelines by focusing on lead time.

## Conclusion
This paper presents a framework for analyzing pipelined systems by abstracting them into subsystems. The **cycle time** of the system is determined by bottlenecks, while the **lead time** is additive across subsystems. For merging pipelines, the slowest cycle time and the shortest lead time dominate. This approach simplifies performance analysis in complex systems and has broad applicability in manufacturing, networking, and software systems.
